*OBJECTIVE*
The objective of this code is to implement a simple neural network using NumPy to classify the "moons" dataset. The model is a basic feedforward neural network trained using backpropagation without any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

*Description of the Model*
The model consists of:
- An input layer with 2 features.
- One hidden layer with 8 neurons using the sigmoid activation function.
- An output layer with 1 neuron using the sigmoid activation function.
- Training is done using the mean squared error (MSE) loss and gradient descent.

The dataset used is the "moons" dataset from sklearn.datasets, which consists of two interleaving half-circle clusters, making it a non-linearly separable problem.

*Description of Code*
1. *Data Preparation*
   - Generates the moons dataset with noise.
   - Splits the dataset into training and test sets.
   - Standardizes the features for better training performance.

2. *Model Initialization*
   - Defines model parameters such as input size, hidden layer size, and output size.
   - Initializes weights and biases with random values.

3. *Training Process*
   - Implements forward propagation using the sigmoid activation function.
   - Computes loss using mean squared error (MSE).
   - Performs backpropagation to compute gradients and update weights and biases.
   - Runs for 500 epochs with weight updates at each iteration.
   - Prints the loss every 100 epochs to track progress.

4. *Evaluation*
   - Computes predictions on the test set.
   - Rounds the sigmoid output to get binary classifications.
   - Computes accuracy as the percentage of correctly classified points.
   - Prints final accuracy and predictions.

*Performance Evaluation*
- The model achieves reasonable accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify the moon dataset.
- Since the sigmoid activation and MSE loss are used, the model may suffer from vanishing gradient issues.
- Performance could be improved using cross-entropy loss and better activation functions like ReLU for hidden layers.

*MY COMMENTS*
- The implementation effectively demonstrates the principles of neural networks without relying on deep learning frameworks.
- Using StandardScaler helps improve convergence and model performance.
- The choice of MSE as the loss function is suboptimal for classification; using binary cross-entropy could improve results.
- Increasing the number of hidden neurons or adding additional layers could enhance performance.
- Implementing early stopping or batch gradient descent could further optimize training.
- Transitioning this implementation to TensorFlow or PyTorch would make it more scalable for larger datasets.
